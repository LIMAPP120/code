    <h2>Description</h2>
    <section>
      A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated
      in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the
      street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the
      1920s.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and
        all-purpose flour.
      </li>
      <li>Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
      <li>
        Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps
        the batter rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
      <li>
        ·Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder,
        which means it helps hold the batter together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as
        vegetable oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can
        use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the batter by combining the dry ingredients, then stirring in the
        milk and egg.
      </li>
      <li>Skewer the frankfurters and roll in the batter.</li>
      <li>
        Spoon the Caprese filling into each avocado half and drizzle with
        balsamic vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>Fry the corn dogs in hot oil until lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
